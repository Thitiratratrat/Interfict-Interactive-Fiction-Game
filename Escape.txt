Hello? 
Is anybody here? 
Did you get my message?
->choice
->1
A: Who are you?
B: Yes I can hear you.
->choiceInput

->Path

->A
Finally a connection!!
Yeah...right sorry I didn't properly introduce myself yet.
Greetings stranger, my name is Luke.
This might be weird and I know we don't know each other but... I really need your help out of this.
->choice

A: Okay..?
B: What do you need help with?
->choiceInput

So somehow...I ended up waking up in this locked room and I can't remember a single thing.
The only thing that I found is this device that connects to you and a note written in rush saying:
WHO AM I?
Ironically it reflects me. I can't remember who I am, what I even look like, or where I am from.
I can only remember my name.
Hmm.. there's one button here on the device I wonder what it is. Let's see what happens when I press it.

*You received a picture of Luke*
You see a brunette man in his early 20s with dark, blue eyes, a freckled face, fair skin, and one undeniably unique feature:
an X scar on his right cheek.

Huh, nothing happend. Oh well.. there's this plaid shirt on the floor and a computer on the desk. What should I check first?
->choice
->3
A: Check the shirt.
B: Check the computer.
->choiceInput

->Path
->3
->A
The shirt is filled with scratches, tears, and oh wow... it has an incredibly ghastly smell.
and hm..? It has.. a..wha..
blood..stains?
what the..
I hope it's just an animal's... or from a wound..
Oh something fell off.
Hm... its a paper with the message
"The password is your question."

Huh... weird.
Guess I will go check out the computer then.
Hm.. it needs a password input...
And it appears to be in cryptogram..
->cryptogram
Who am I?
->cryptogramEnd
Yes! It's correct! 
Oh? It appears to be a video footage.
Oh
Oh my God
What the...
It's.. it's a video of a man... killing another woman.. it appears to be right in this room.. and now.. God..
he's dragging the corpse to the bathroom...
It's the door that on the right that I haven't opened yet...
He's looking at himself in the mirror.
Wait he's turning his face.
I..
I could..
I could see his face..
What a ghostly and devilish smile he has... 
Among those freckled cheeks, dark brown hair, and mysterious dark blue eyes, his X mark on his cheek is the most prominent.
Isn't it just..horrible..?
Whoever did this?
Hey I think I can hear police sirens.
What should I do?
->choice
->4
A: Wait for the police.
B: Open the bathroom door.
->choiceInput

->Path
->4
->A
Right.. I should wait... I didn't do anything wrong did I?
The police are barging in and here they are! Help!
I can now be rescued! 

Wait what? Huh? NO! Why are you arresting me?! HELP!!!! 
HELP!!!

Good ending. You helped arrested Luke.
->END

->Path

Okay.. I'm going in.
Oh.
Oh god the corpse is there..
and huh?
Oh
oh...
the mirror..
now I REMEMBER..
The man in the video is me after all huh.
So this is who I am.

Well, thanks for helping me remember. I hope we do meet in real life though, but when we do, just be careful for a *nice* surprise.
Oh haha now the police are here.
Well, it's time for me to escape now.
Goodbye.
See you
SOON

Hmm.. the computer is locked with a passcode.. I just can't get in..
